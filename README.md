## Project Overview

This project is part of a school course led by Professor Helene Coullon, and you can find more about her work at [helene-coullon.fr](https://helene-coullon.fr/). The initial repository for this project can be found on [GitHub]($https://github.com/IMTA-FIL/UE-AD-A1-MIXTE).

The main objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of micro-service architecture, focusing on the usage of gRPC and GraphQL APIs and the Flask framework.

### Project Tasks

In this project, we tackled the following key tasks:

1. **Movie Service Enhancements**
    - We rewrote the Movie service in GraphQL.
    - 
3. **User Microservice Development**
    - We modified the User service to make GraphQL requests instead of REST.
    - We created new routes.
  
4. **Booking Service and Times Service Enhancements**
    - The Booking and Times services transitioned to offering gRPC APIs :
    - We created proto API files for the Times service.
    - We implemented the code for the Times service and tested it using a gRPC client.
    - We also created proto API files for the Booking service and implemented its code and testing it with gRPC clients.

5. **Microservice Testing**
    - Thoroughly tested all microservices with Postman.
  
## Start the project. 

To start the project : 
1. Clone the project repository
2. Start all services in command prompt or in a code editor like PyCHarm.
3. You can then test them with test.user.py for example or with PostMan.
